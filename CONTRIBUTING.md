## Contribution Steps

1. Fork the repo, make changes, commit, and submit a Pull Request

2. New Pull Requests will automatically trigger a Travis CI Build

3. If the build fails, look at the [Build Logs](https://travis-ci.org/r-spacex/SpaceX-API).
Changes will not be merged unless the build passes.

4. If the build succeeds, the pull request will be merged, and automatically
pushed to the staging server at [http://stage.spacexdata.com/v1/](http://stage.spacexdata.com/v1/) for a
final check before promoting changes to production at [https://api.spacexdata.com/v1/](https://api.spacexdata.com/v1/).
